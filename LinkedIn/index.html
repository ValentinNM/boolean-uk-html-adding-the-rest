<!-- THIS IS TO BE THE
    LINKIND LAYOUT 

    Description
Now that we've worked on the base layouts of these popular sites, it's time to take it a step further and start adding in the smaller details

Instructions
- Recreate the LinkedIn layout from the screenshot below
- Add the components to each section of the layout

Challenge
Once you're done with the layout, try turning those smaller blocks into more detailed components, with text, images, etc. 
Make sure they stay responsive, accommodating all the new components you add.
